\topic{3. Cloth}
In general, cloth simulation is the process of making a sheet-like material deform under gravity, collisions, and internal stretch, shear, and bend forces.
Other methods: mass-spring systems, position-based dynamics/extended PBD, projective dynamics, thin-shell FEM, yarn-level models.

  \item $<a, b> = a^Tb = a \cdot b$
  \item \equ{E=\frac{k}{2}<C(x), C(x)> = \frac{k}{2}||C(x)||^2} 
  \item Force: $f = - \frac{\partial E}{\partial x} = - k \frac{\partial C}{\partial x}\cdot C$
  \item Energy: $E = E_{stretch} + E_{shear} + E_{bend}$
  \item Hessian: $H = \frac{\partial F}{\partial x}$
  \item Cloth simulation in the Large Steps in Cloth Simulation (Baraff \& Witkin, 1998) framework treats a piece of fabric as a triangle mesh whose physical state is described by three energy terms—stretch, shear, and bend—plus an implicit time integrator that lets us take very large time steps without blowing up.

\subsubtitle{Stretch:}
\lis{
  \item $(u,v) \in R^2 \mapsto w(u,v) \in R^3$
  \item $||\frac{dw}{du}|| = ||\frac{dw}{dv}||$ = 1 when not streched where $\frac{dw}{du} \in R^3$, $\frac{dw}{dv} \in R^3$
  \item \equ{C_{stretch}(x) = a \cdot 
  \begin{bmatrix}
  ||\frac{dw}{du}|| - 1 \\
  ||\frac{dw}{dv}|| - 1 
  \end{bmatrix}
  } can model both stetch and compress
  \item $a$: triangle area of every triangle
  \item $C_{stretch}(x)$: how strongly the stretch is
  \item Energy $E_{stretch} = \frac{k_{stretch}}{2}<C_{stretch}, C_{stretch}>$
}

\subsubtitle{Shear:}
\lis{
  \item more shear, $\frac{dw}{dv}$ and $\frac{dw}{du}$ are more close to each other
  \item \equ{C(x) = a \cdot <\frac{dw}{du}, \frac{dw}{dv}> / (||\frac{dw}{du}|| \cdot ||\frac{dw}{dv}||)}
  \item $<\frac{dw}{du}, \frac{dw}{dv}>$ when no shear, dot product = 0
  \item $/ (||\frac{dw}{du}|| \cdot ||\frac{dw}{dv}||)$ omit, because it is close to 1
}

\subsubtitle{Bend:}
\lis{
  \item Suppose flat, check the dihedral angle $\theta$ between two adjacent triangles 
  \item 4 vertices, $3 \times 4 = 12$ DOF 
  \item $cos(\theta) = N_1 \cdot N_2$
  \item $sin(\theta) = (N_1 \times N_2) \cdot e$ where e is a unit vector along the common edge
  \item \equ{C(x) = \theta = arctan\frac{sin\theta}{cos\theta}}
  \item $E = \frac{k_{bend}}{2}\theta^2$
  \item limitation: material property
  \item \name{Kawabata evaluation system}: used to measure the mechanical properties of fabrics (1982). Test to check qualitative match, quantitative match is impossible
