\subsubtitle{History}
\lis{
  \item Particle systems 
  \item Flocking systems 
  \item Behavioral systems 
}

\subsubtitle{Particle Systems}
\lis{
  \item Tens of Thousands of members
  \item No intelligence 
  \item Respond to global forces, including collision reaction
}

\subsubtitle{Flocking Systems}
\lis{
  \item Thousands of memebrs 
  \item Limited intelligence 
  \item Some physical basis 
  \item Collision avoidance 
  \item Local control system 
}

\subsubtitle{Flocks, Herds, and Schools: A Distributed Behavioral Model}
\lis{
  \item "Boids" given simple behavioral constraints: Separation; Alignment; Cohesion 
  \item Often cited as one of the first examples of flocking and emergent behavior 
  \item Craig Reynolds 1987
}

\subsubtitle{Behavioral Systems}
\lis{
  \item Tens to thousands of members 
  \item Each member is highly intelligent 
  \item Collision avoidance 
  \item Behavior based on rules 
}

\subtitle{Boids Algorithm}

\subsubtitle{Simulated Flocks}
\lis{
  \item Create a boid model that supports geometric flight
  \item Add individual behaviors that oppose each other: Separation; Alignment; Cohesion; Obstacle Avoidance 
  \item The boids must be able to arbitrate conflicting behaviors as well.
  \item \equ{r}: weights (how far away)
  \item \equ{c}: constant 
  \item \equ{a}: acceleration 
  \item \equ{v}: relative velocity of $i$
}

\subsubtitle{Simulated Flocks: Separation} \equ{a_{sep}=c_{sep}\cdot \sum_{i}(1/r_i^2)n_i}
\lis{
  \item Avoid crowding local boids
}

\subsubtitle{Simulated FLocks: Alignment} \equ{a_{align}=c_{align}\cdot (\sum_{i}(1/r_i^2)v_i)\cdot 1/(\sum_{i}(1/r_i^2))}
\lis{
  \item Steer toward the general heading of the rest of the flock 
}

\subsubtitle{Simulated Flocks: Cohesion} \equ{a_{coh}=c_{coh}\cdot (\sum_{i}(1/r_i^2)x_i)\cdot 1/(\sum_{i}(1/r_i^2))}
\lis{
  \item Move toward the average position of local flockmates
}

\subsubtitle{Avoiding Obstacles}
\lis{
  \item Independently model the shape for rendering and collision avoidance 
  \item Boids model uses a steer-to-avoid as opposed to force-field concept.
}

\subsubtitle{Putting it all together} \equ{a=a_{sep}+a_{coh}+a_{align}+a_{coll}}
\lis{
  \item Simulated Flocking behavior that mimics real life flocks and herds: When combined with low priority goal seeking results in a scripted path of the flock 
}

\subsubtitle{Conclusion}
\lis{
  \item Boids is a model of non-colliding motion of flocks based on simulating behavior of individual boids 
  \item Boid model is an example of emergent behavior: Simple local rules lead to complex global behavior
}

\subsubtitle{Acceleration Quota}
\lis{
  \item priotize $a_{coll}$ when nearly collide
